### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! my name is Brent and I am currently on my way to become a professional software developer. I have always been fascinated with the tech world and want to delve into it as much as I can. A fun fact about me is I love to play games. Anything game related has me written all over it whether it be board or video I am always down to play and learn any game.
